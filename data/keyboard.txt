Review: I really enjoy this keyboard. It is gasket mounted and comes with cherry profile keycaps. This makes for a really comfortable feel. Between the added flexibility from the gasket mount, and the ergonomics of the cherry profile it is a very comfortable typing and gaming experience. Now for the switches, they were alright. I personally don't like linears, some of you might. They are good for what they are though. They are pre-lubed white Outemu switches. They sound pretty good for someone who likes linears, I just don't. So I switched to Akko cream blue v3 pros. Mainly because my favorite switches are tactile, and those switches sound amazing. They have a creamy sound with a nice tactile bump, as well as some nice thock from the actual keyboard itself. I don't know if you are planning on buying it for the retail price of $100, but if you are I'd say its a good choice. I got it for $60, so it was discounted, and I tell you what for that price this is a really good keyboard. I also forgot to mention I changed the keycaps on my keyboard so the ones in the picture aren't the ones that come with it. The ones that come with it are very nice though. Once again it was just a preference for me to have keycaps with shine through. The keycaps that come with it are of good quality and sound good as well. Overall this is a really good keyboard. Only thing I want is for it to be easier to get on the inside of this thing to be able to mod it and personalize it further than just switches and keycaps.

Review: Loved this keyboard. The customizability, the comfort, how it sounds, the colors, and strobing that you can customize. The little LED screen that was home to a dancing toothless GIF. I loved it. It just wasn't strong enough to handle the siege rage. 10/10 would buy it again.

Review: Never in my life have i heard of xvx, but this is the most QUALITY keyboard i think i have ever laid my hands on. For its low price i felt like this was going to be mediocre at best. But trust me when i say, every time i use this keyboard. I blurt out loud "i love this keyboard". The keys are so solid. The linear keys feel amazing. The sound of the keyboard SOUDS like its worth more than what i paid. I can't emphasize enough how nice this things is. Customizing my own function keys feels amazing. I made it so the xvx software loads on start up. Oh and the software is obviously well thought out. So smooth and snappy. I would shake the devs hand if i could.Buy this keyboard or at the very least buy an xvx keyboard that fits you. Its well worth it.I can go on forever about the things i love about this purchase. And i hope the people making these see my review because i truely want you to know how much you have improved my gaming and daily computer experience. I love it.

Title: Top Quality & Aesthetic Design

Review: The media could not be loaded.
                



If you are interested in transitioning from an old school to mechanical keyboard, want something with an absolutely sick looking design, is simple to use, and doesn't have insanely loud key press noises, this is definitely a top option! I have had this unboxed for barely 30 minutes and am already in love with it. It was super easy to plug-n-play and use the built in functions immediately.I have used old style, full-length keyboards for decades and was extremely hesitant to try out a mechanical keyboard, especially because of the noise I had heard from seeing video reviews and how unsure I was if I could deal with the loss of full buttonology. One major reason I looked into one of this type/size was that I realized one of the main reasons I have issues with soreness and pain in my left shoulder, neck, and upper arm is due to how I would position my left hand and tilt the keyboard in order to use the traditional movement keys WASX on a full sized keyboard for gaming. With this one, my arm is now in a natural resting position at 90 degrees against my side, negating the angular stress on all those muscle groups, and when I want to do some typing while gaming, I don't have to stretch across the board to my left as much with my right hand to get to home keys.Additionally, one big assumption killer was that, even though the size is cut down by a ton from a full-sized keyboard, the muscle memory transition to the slightly more compacted keys took hardly any time at all when typing with home keys. I type about 100 WPM, so I assumed I'd have a super difficult time with this aspect of the transition, but the spacing of keys doesn't have a huge difference of feel. The other big plus is that the noise level isn't huge on key press when gaming, and is not bothersome when typing; it's not that high pitched clickity clack you might get from many other types, rather a dull, thud-like sound.Now add in the amazing painted design (especially if you like Japanese wood block print/art), and the colored light functions, which mind you are accessible by using the keyboard and the built in mini screen aka not requiring you to download software, as well as the pre-programmed FN + <key> functions that replace the buttons you lost from a full sized keyboard, and this thing is just a dream.HIGHLY RECOMMEND to one and all, especially old folks like me that are afraid to make that leap into transitioning to a mechanical style board.P.S.: If you're looking for actual dimensions of the keyboard itself, which are not on this Amazon page nor on the company's item page, they are approximately as follows: 12.75"x5.75"x1.375"-0.875" (the last number is the height, without the height extenders being used, at the top of the keyboard vs. at the bottom. it slopes upward towards the back)

Review: I had a Corsair k-something special edition (can‚Äôt remember the exact model) and it was great but I wanted a more compact gaming board with quieter keys. (The Corsair one was ungodly loud)This board is very sleek and nice looking, has a sweet little screen you can set gifs onto, and can monitor some pc stuff, also customize the lighting on the board on. The keys are quiet yet still has that satisfying sound to them and I really like that. Super comfortable board and for like 60 bucks it‚Äôs a pretty sick deal. I‚Äôm stoked on it and will be getting more for gifts come holiday season.

Review: literally the best keyboard ive had. EVER. so first off, for 70 dollars its the most expensive keyboard ive owned. but this thing feels like its solid 150 dollar range especially with that very cool screen thing on the top right. awesome and i put a lil gif on it. also on top of that, IT SOUNDS SO GOOD DUDE!!! like from what ive heard the switches are prelubed AND this crap has a dampener on it, so it sounds amazing. like it sounds so good dude. its also not unbelievably loud and again, sounds phenomenal like no joke this is solidly the best keyboard ive owned. the software is pretty good too tho i havent used it that much.overall a solid 10/10 im not even joking, please buy this keyboard

Review: Got mine on a bit of a sale for $60. At that price it‚Äôs a steal. I love how it looks, the backlighting gets nice and bright, the switches are smooth, and it just has a much better feel and sound than the more budget mechanical keyboards, such as the rk61 (which is still good but this one is better imo). The little screen up top is a pretty cool feature for customization, but the software is not the easiest to use. Overall I am very pleased and will be getting another one for my girlfriend‚Äôs set up.

Review: I was a bit skeptical of this keyboard at first as there were no reviews for this model and for everything it offered for the price it seemed too good, that there had to be some shortcuts, however this keyboard has surprised me in every way and I'm glad I took the chance on this.Not only does the keyboard sound, feel and look amazing but the build quality is top notch too. While the housing is plastic so it's a bit lighter than other mechanical keyboards it still feels sturdy and I imagine it's how they can easily get the artwork on there which is phenomenal in quality. Even with this base they still managed to make it sound great, the switches and stabs feel like they're properly lubed with good enough dampening too with no pinging noise from what I can tell. And best of all the switches are hot swappable with either 5 or 3 pin switches!!The software for this keyboard is some of the best I've used as well. It offers the typical RGB customization for multiple effects (including audio spectrum), options to upload gifs to the little screen, and probably my favorite section that lets you customize literally any key you want; to do whatever you want: from media controls to making it do macros, to being a different key entirely. I was able to bind fn+shift to be print screen which is great since I use that key all the time.As for the screen.. it's alright really. The viewing angles aren't great but being able to have a little gif playing on your keyboard is kinda neat.My only personal gripe is the positioning of the arrow keys but it has grown on me a little.Overall this has been hands down the best keyboard I've had and I would easily recommend this keyboard if it suits your style.

Also very smooth and I love the feature to put a little gif in the corner. The setup is super easy and the USB-C power cord makes it easy to store away and plug in. Highly recommend for any one that needs a gaming keyboard or an overall just regular use.

Title: A Surprisingly Solid $59 Keyboard
Rating: 5.0

Review: Bought it on sale for $59.49 as a gift for a family member, a lot of nice features on it for that price. These were my first keycaps that have a little grit to them and surprisingly felt nice to type on. The prelubed keyboard switches feel more shallow than other keyswitches that I have tried but regardless, were smooth and and sound nice. The modifier keys also have little to no ticking from the stabilizers, which was a surprise considering other keyboards that I have bought from other vendors have had serious problems with ticking from their stabilizers. I was also surprised that there was no case ping with my unit. My only complaint with the keyboard would be that the case feels cheap, but for the previously mentioned sale price on top of the keyboard not really needing any modifications, it's an excellent keyboard to gift to someone.

Review: Initially promises an immersive gaming experience. However, the allure fades quickly upon the realization that the accompanying software triggers security warnings from multiple antivirus programs, including Norton. This raises significant concerns about the safety and integrity of the software, casting a shadow over the keyboard's usability. While the hardware may be satisfactory, the potential risk posed by the software is a serious disappointment, undermining the overall value of the product. It's disheartening when the excitement of a new gadget is dampened by such issues, especially when the market has safer, more reliable options available.

absolutely amazing for the price! I was intending on buying a different and was really upset when I found out I had ordered the wrong keyboard. So when I opened the package I said "Might as well try it out". But, as soon as I started trying it out I immediately changed my mind and decided to keep it. I cannot express how amazed I was at the quality of this keyboard. The thing that made me change my mind were the LED lights. As I was testing out the keyboard I was messing around with OLED screen thing to see what I could do with the LED lights. I don't think they advertise this above but there are MULTIPLE options for the LED's where the lights react to which keys you press! Also the gif quality in the top right corner of the keyboard is actually really high quality for a screen that small. When I was purchasing this I was really expecting it to be just a couple low quality pixels but no! I genuinely recommend buying this!

Review: Honestly I love the sound of the keyboard, it isn't loud or too soft. The keyboard is very high quality and and the little gif is very cool too since you can change it.

Review: This keyboard is extremely well made, and for someone who wants a custom built and pre-lubricated keyboard, without the hassle of building it themselves, XVX keyboards are the best you'll find on amazon. And yes, it thocks.Also, alongside an XVX G705 mouse and a mousepad it arrived from the US to my country in Eastern Europe within 3 days.

Review: Not much to say, sounds really good, the led is nice with the different effects, and you can also change the keycaps and switches. It comes with a screen where you can change the color, effect, brightness and so on. In general, a really nice gaming keyboard.

Buen material (las keycaps doradas yo se las puse) y que tenga software para editar tanto los colores, personalizaci√≥n de teclas y tambi√©n para poner lo que sea en la pantalla est√° genial

Review: Ok so my delivery driver was late cause it was like 2 meters of snow but I got it a day after, and when I got it that day it was to good! Like I had some trouble understanding how to change the facets and the effects where crazy there were Rgb special color choosing and the value for money is the best part, it look cool and came with a key switch thing which was cool. If u need help switching the Rgb effects etc just press, FN which is on the bottom right like next to the space bar. And yeah press the arrow button as well like the pointer thingy know what I mean or just search it online idc what u do but buy this, this is insane value! Don‚Äôt report me!‡ºº‚Å∞o‚Å∞Ôºõ‡ºΩÍí≥·µíÍí≥·µé·µé·µé
