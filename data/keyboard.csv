5.0,Good keyboard for the price!,"I really enjoy this keyboard. It is gasket mounted and comes with cherry profile keycaps. This makes for a really comfortable feel. Between the added flexibility from the gasket mount, and the ergonomics of the cherry profile it is a very comfortable typing and gaming experience. Now for the switches, they were alright. I personally don't like linears, some of you might. They are good for what they are though. They are pre-lubed white Outemu switches. They sound pretty good for someone who likes linears, I just don't. So I switched to Akko cream blue v3 pros. Mainly because my favorite switches are tactile, and those switches sound amazing. They have a creamy sound with a nice tactile bump, as well as some nice thock from the actual keyboard itself. I don't know if you are planning on buying it for the retail price of $100, but if you are I'd say its a good choice. I got it for $60, so it was discounted, and I tell you what for that price this is a really good keyboard. I also forgot to mention I changed the keycaps on my keyboard so the ones in the picture aren't the ones that come with it. The ones that come with it are very nice though. Once again it was just a preference for me to have keycaps with shine through. The keycaps that come with it are of good quality and sound good as well. Overall this is a really good keyboard. Only thing I want is for it to be easier to get on the inside of this thing to be able to mod it and personalize it further than just switches and keycaps.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GzFieJCuL._SY88.jpg
5.0,Great keyboard. A little weak to gamer rage but overall a very solid keyboard.,"Loved this keyboard. The customizability, the comfort, how it sounds, the colors, and strobing that you can customize. The little LED screen that was home to a dancing toothless GIF. I loved it. It just wasn't strong enough to handle the siege rage. 10/10 would buy it again.",
5.0,A must buy,"Never in my life have i heard of xvx, but this is the most QUALITY keyboard i think i have ever laid my hands on. For its low price i felt like this was going to be mediocre at best. But trust me when i say, every time i use this keyboard. I blurt out loud ""i love this keyboard"". The keys are so solid. The linear keys feel amazing. The sound of the keyboard SOUDS like its worth more than what i paid. I can't emphasize enough how nice this things is. Customizing my own function keys feels amazing. I made it so the xvx software loads on start up. Oh and the software is obviously well thought out. So smooth and snappy. I would shake the devs hand if i could.Buy this keyboard or at the very least buy an xvx keyboard that fits you. Its well worth it.I can go on forever about the things i love about this purchase. And i hope the people making these see my review because i truely want you to know how much you have improved my gaming and daily computer experience. I love it.",
5.0,Top Quality & Aesthetic Design,"The media could not be loaded.
                



If you are interested in transitioning from an old school to mechanical keyboard, want something with an absolutely sick looking design, is simple to use, and doesn't have insanely loud key press noises, this is definitely a top option! I have had this unboxed for barely 30 minutes and am already in love with it. It was super easy to plug-n-play and use the built in functions immediately.I have used old style, full-length keyboards for decades and was extremely hesitant to try out a mechanical keyboard, especially because of the noise I had heard from seeing video reviews and how unsure I was if I could deal with the loss of full buttonology. One major reason I looked into one of this type/size was that I realized one of the main reasons I have issues with soreness and pain in my left shoulder, neck, and upper arm is due to how I would position my left hand and tilt the keyboard in order to use the traditional movement keys WASX on a full sized keyboard for gaming. With this one, my arm is now in a natural resting position at 90 degrees against my side, negating the angular stress on all those muscle groups, and when I want to do some typing while gaming, I don't have to stretch across the board to my left as much with my right hand to get to home keys.Additionally, one big assumption killer was that, even though the size is cut down by a ton from a full-sized keyboard, the muscle memory transition to the slightly more compacted keys took hardly any time at all when typing with home keys. I type about 100 WPM, so I assumed I'd have a super difficult time with this aspect of the transition, but the spacing of keys doesn't have a huge difference of feel. The other big plus is that the noise level isn't huge on key press when gaming, and is not bothersome when typing; it's not that high pitched clickity clack you might get from many other types, rather a dull, thud-like sound.Now add in the amazing painted design (especially if you like Japanese wood block print/art), and the colored light functions, which mind you are accessible by using the keyboard and the built in mini screen aka not requiring you to download software, as well as the pre-programmed FN + <key> functions that replace the buttons you lost from a full sized keyboard, and this thing is just a dream.HIGHLY RECOMMEND to one and all, especially old folks like me that are afraid to make that leap into transitioning to a mechanical style board.P.S.: If you're looking for actual dimensions of the keyboard itself, which are not on this Amazon page nor on the company's item page, they are approximately as follows: 12.75""x5.75""x1.375""-0.875"" (the last number is the height, without the height extenders being used, at the top of the keyboard vs. at the bottom. it slopes upward towards the back)",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PV8C1s8gL._SY88.jpg
4.0,Great RGB keyboard,Comfortable to use for long gaming sessions. The RGB lights are gorgeous and really customizable right from the keyboard without the software being needed.,
5.0,Best budget gaming keyboard,"I had a Corsair k-something special edition (can‚Äôt remember the exact model) and it was great but I wanted a more compact gaming board with quieter keys. (The Corsair one was ungodly loud)This board is very sleek and nice looking, has a sweet little screen you can set gifs onto, and can monitor some pc stuff, also customize the lighting on the board on. The keys are quiet yet still has that satisfying sound to them and I really like that. Super comfortable board and for like 60 bucks it‚Äôs a pretty sick deal. I‚Äôm stoked on it and will be getting more for gifts come holiday season.",
5.0,Gaming keyboard,This keyboard sounds so good and feels so good probably one of the best keyboards I‚Äôve ever bought. This keyboard has a cool display that you can change and it‚Äôs so cute if you want to buy this as a gift for someone it would be great. üëç,
5.0,great keyboard,"great sound, well made, great value, no regrets and i hope they keeping making this model",
5.0,phenomenal,"literally the best keyboard ive had. EVER. so first off, for 70 dollars its the most expensive keyboard ive owned. but this thing feels like its solid 150 dollar range especially with that very cool screen thing on the top right. awesome and i put a lil gif on it. also on top of that, IT SOUNDS SO GOOD DUDE!!! like from what ive heard the switches are prelubed AND this crap has a dampener on it, so it sounds amazing. like it sounds so good dude. its also not unbelievably loud and again, sounds phenomenal like no joke this is solidly the best keyboard ive owned. the software is pretty good too tho i havent used it that much.overall a solid 10/10 im not even joking, please buy this keyboard",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81dUdmJgTRL._SY88.jpg
5.0,Very good keyboard,"Got mine on a bit of a sale for $60. At that price it‚Äôs a steal. I love how it looks, the backlighting gets nice and bright, the switches are smooth, and it just has a much better feel and sound than the more budget mechanical keyboards, such as the rk61 (which is still good but this one is better imo). The little screen up top is a pretty cool feature for customization, but the software is not the easiest to use. Overall I am very pleased and will be getting another one for my girlfriend‚Äôs set up.",
5.0,Great aesthetics and hot swappable,I loved the way this keyboard looked. I had to change the switches since I like clicky more than tactile or linear like sounds. Very easy to change and pleasing to the eyes. This keyboard is also very light unlike the glorious gmmk or ducky.,
5.0,never been happier with a purchase,"I didn't know keyboards could be this nice! I want to type a longer review just to hear the click clack of it, so satisfying. the art on it is top notch and I love looking at it with the keystroke lighting effect reacting to my inputs in a physical sense is so satisfying.",
5.0,Perfect keyboard,"I bought this keyboard because I saw it was on sale and it was one of the best purchases I‚Äôve made. Not only does it sound great but the features are on point, it also has plenty of different colored lights. I would highly recommend this keyboard.",
4.0,Good with probloms,Only reason I'm rating it a 4 is because i dont look at the keyboard while typing but they sent me one that has 2 5s one of them is suppose to have a six then I have a six as a 7,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AQW1Q1LSL._SY88.jpg

4.0,Son loves the keyboard,Unique keyboard. Son loves that you can put a picture on the keyboard.,
5.0,Pleasantly surprised,"For a lower priced mechanical keyboard I wasn't sure what to expect and it exceeded all of my expectations. Nice sound, great key caps, and wire routing. Would definitely recommend to someone looking for a decent mechanical keyboard as a budget friendly option.",
5.0,GOOD,its a pretty good keyboard the RGB lights are awesome the feeling when typing is really smooth overall i recommend it for this price :),
5.0,"Extremely smooth keystrokes, fantastic quality","it works perfectly and is extremely solid for around $70. the little LCD screen on it is a bit weird for gifs because it has that effect where if you move your head around, it gets inverted and the colors are all weird but it does work and it's a neat little extra featurethe only legitimate problem is that the website for the software to customize it is broken, i wasn't able to access it at all but a reddit post pointed me to a download for it",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61k1okWxkAL._SY88.jpg
5.0,Perfect!,"About the size it's pretty good if you want more space in your desk. Very soft and satisfactory in the first use. About the style and colors, it's very good quality. I really recommend if you love the Japanese Culture.",
5.0,Price to quality ratio is extremely good,headline,
5.0,I'm so glad I found this,"I was a bit skeptical of this keyboard at first as there were no reviews for this model and for everything it offered for the price it seemed too good, that there had to be some shortcuts, however this keyboard has surprised me in every way and I'm glad I took the chance on this.Not only does the keyboard sound, feel and look amazing but the build quality is top notch too. While the housing is plastic so it's a bit lighter than other mechanical keyboards it still feels sturdy and I imagine it's how they can easily get the artwork on there which is phenomenal in quality. Even with this base they still managed to make it sound great, the switches and stabs feel like they're properly lubed with good enough dampening too with no pinging noise from what I can tell. And best of all the switches are hot swappable with either 5 or 3 pin switches!!The software for this keyboard is some of the best I've used as well. It offers the typical RGB customization for multiple effects (including audio spectrum), options to upload gifs to the little screen, and probably my favorite section that lets you customize literally any key you want; to do whatever you want: from media controls to making it do macros, to being a different key entirely. I was able to bind fn+shift to be print screen which is great since I use that key all the time.As for the screen.. it's alright really. The viewing angles aren't great but being able to have a little gif playing on your keyboard is kinda neat.My only personal gripe is the positioning of the arrow keys but it has grown on me a little.Overall this has been hands down the best keyboard I've had and I would easily recommend this keyboard if it suits your style.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lY+RKi9LL._SY88.jpg
5.0,Great Product,Sometimes the size makes you believe there is a built in battery but there is not its completely wired.,
5.0,Great keyboard,Needed a smaller keyboard since my old one felt too spread out. I love the key bindings on this and the noise level is perfect. I would get complaints from my friends that they could hear my keyboard from my microphone. With this set I haven't heard them complain once. Also very smooth and I love the feature to put a little gif in the corner. The setup is super easy and the USB-C power cord makes it easy to store away and plug in. Highly recommend for any one that needs a gaming keyboard or an overall just regular use.,
5.0,Love this thing!,"Usually don't write reviews, but this keyboard is sock. Very well made compared to others I've had! Definitely worth the buy.",
4.0,Great Keyboard,The XVX S-K80 is an awesome keyboard and sounds great. Two thinks I don‚Äôt like about it is how late and delayed it was (9+ days late). It was definitely worth the wait though because the latency is literally in the negatives and is a great keyboard if your looking for hardcore gaming.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+4hsvRy8L._SY88.jpg

5.0,A Surprisingly Solid $59 Keyboard,"Bought it on sale for $59.49 as a gift for a family member, a lot of nice features on it for that price. These were my first keycaps that have a little grit to them and surprisingly felt nice to type on. The prelubed keyboard switches feel more shallow than other keyswitches that I have tried but regardless, were smooth and and sound nice. The modifier keys also have little to no ticking from the stabilizers, which was a surprise considering other keyboards that I have bought from other vendors have had serious problems with ticking from their stabilizers. I was also surprised that there was no case ping with my unit. My only complaint with the keyboard would be that the case feels cheap, but for the previously mentioned sale price on top of the keyboard not really needing any modifications, it's an excellent keyboard to gift to someone.",

absolutely amazing for the price! I was intending on buying a different and was really upset when I found out I had ordered the wrong keyboard. So when I opened the package I said ""Might as well try it out"". But, as soon as I started trying it out I immediately changed my mind and decided to keep it. I cannot express how amazed I was at the quality of this keyboard. The thing that made me change my mind were the LED lights. As I was testing out the keyboard I was messing around with OLED screen thing to see what I could do with the LED lights. I don't think they advertise this above but there are MULTIPLE options for the LED's where the lights react to which keys you press! Also the gif quality in the top right corner of the keyboard is actually really high quality for a screen that small.
